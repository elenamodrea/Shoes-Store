This was a teams project. We created a desktop application in Java. <br />
This application can be used by 3 types of users: admin, client and employer. <br />

This application allows clients to register. In order for the registration to be complete, the customer must enter the code from the received email. <br />
The client is the only one who can register. The admin has to send credentials for employers in order for them to log in. <br />
